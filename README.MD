# React Machine Coding Rounds

This repository contains my practice projects for machine coding rounds. These exercises are designed to strengthen my frontend development skills and help me prepare for technical interviews at top startups and MNCs.

## Interview Coding Round Question 1

**Problem Statement:**

> Fetch data from an API (like [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)).  
> Display a list of items filtered by their `id` values.  
> Initially, show only items with **even IDs**.  
> When the toggle button is clicked, switch the view to show only items with **odd IDs**, and vice versa.
